Cytosim is a simulation of the cytoskeleton

#documentation
The documentation was generated by ‘doxygen’ and should be read in a browser:
Open `html/index.html’.

In the documentation, you will find a module describing how to compile cytosim. On Mac OS X and Linux this should be straightforward if you are familiar with compilation in general. On Windows, you might want to compile within Cygwin.

Once cytosim is running on your machine, open doc.html, check the tutorial, the page on ‘Running Simulations’, and the examples contained in the folder ‘cym’. We recommend starting with the shortest configuration files (e.g. fiber.cym). Finally, do not hesitate to contact us if you have difficulties: cytosim@cytosim.org

We hope cytosim can be useful for your research. 

Sincerely yours,
     The developers of Cytosim
